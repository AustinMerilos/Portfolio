        I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old. Back in the day
        I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came
        up with a few sites where I could host the Flash animations I was making
        for my friends. Later, the game changed and the cool stuff was made with
        Dreamweaver, so I used it to make fan-club websites for my favourite
        musicians. When social media came around I was making myspace websites
        look stunning (14 year old me thought so) with my sick html / css
        skills. Since then I haven’t stopped learning and creating. I have been
        involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic
        engineering, programming, video production, feature film
        post-production, VR games, and 3D sound. In the last few years, I have
        been increasingly working on software development in my professional
        life. I’ve been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and
        designers, who have taught me what’s expected from a quality product.
